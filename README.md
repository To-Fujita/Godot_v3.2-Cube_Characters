# Godot_v3.2-Cube_Characters
## 1. Description:
I have tried to create some simple Cube_Characters with animations based on Godot Engine ver. 3.2.  
It is very easy to change their textures and to add some new animations.
## 2. Demo:
[Cube Characters Animation Demo](https://to-fujita.github.io/Godot_v3.2-Cube_Characters/Cube_Characters_Demo.html)  
This Demo is confirmed by Microsoft Edge (Ver. 11.0.17763.379), Firefox (Ver. 65.0.2/64 bit) and Google Chrome (Ver. 73.0.3683.86/64 bit) under the condition of Windows 10.
## 3. Usage:

### 3-1. Cubes
It is needed 10 cubes for a chracter. That is a head, a body, 4 sets of arms and 4 sets of legs. The size for each cube is shown in above.  The caracter size is able to change by setting the scale. 
### 3-2. Textures
A texture for an aspect is a square (n x n pixels). The texture image size for a cube is 3n x 2n. Please refer to the image above.  
In this time, the textures are created based on the paper craft of CUBEECRAFT.
### 3-3. Animations
I have created several simple animations as a demo. The animation is able to create by to set the positions and the rotations of each cube on animation player.
